Revolgy Delivery team way of work. We create own our guidelines. We change them if they do not fit our work anymore.

## üå≤ Trunk-based development
`Trunk` is a main rolling branch. Releases are cut from the `trunk` branch. There are also several approaches on how to cut releases with trunk-based workflow: e.g. [from the `trunk` directly](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/release-from-trunk/) or [from separate release branch](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-for-release/).

### Overview

- There are no `feature` or `hotfix` branches, only one continuous branch exists and it is `trunk`. Every change is being developed in its own temporary branch created off `trunk`.
- Any change cannot be directly merged without testing, tests executed and the test coverage must be part of MR/PR.
- The developer or engineer does not have to pick a correct branch to start his/her work: for each feature, fix, whatever we create a temporary branch with a descriptive name (e.g. `feature:mTLS_support` or `chore:dependencies_cleanup`) deleted after the tests and successful merge approval.
- `trunk` is an active rolling branch with the latest code which can (and should) be continuously deployed into the **testing** environment.
- When we cut a new release, a `release` branch is created and the release commit is being tagged with a version number. Stick to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We follow this logic in versioning {MAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH}.
  - Semantic versioning rules:
      1. MAJOR version when you make significant release changes,
      2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner. In Revolgy context this is new feature addition like a new monitoring service eg. Splunk in Terraform.
      3. PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes. Here we count also hotfixes.
- Tagged releases can be then deployed by CI/CD pipeline.
- `trunk` branch is periodically merged into the current `release` and when a new version of the current release should be issued, appropriate commit is being tagged with new version number.
- if we run into a situation when we need to backport (or sync-back) something into an older release branch which is not in sync with `trunk` anymore, we cherry-pick a single commit from the `trunk` and tag a new version of this older release.

Related patterns of behavior for code management and branching:

- Peer review is mandatory and should be done thoroughly and responsibly
- Each MR should be continuously tested
- squash and merge all the MRs, again with reasonable commit message.
  - except when syncing `trunk` into `release` (to preserve history for potential cherry-picking)
- MR should contain reasonable description. See the template:

```markdown
	This MR contains a feature set regarding the new API update for WAF v2.0 with new rules for CoolClient.io.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: IMPORTANT SHORT MESSAGE - DELETES, OPS NOTE ETC.

### Trunk-based development flow

![Diagram](./img/trunk_based_development.png?raw=true)

The diagram above shows a complete life cycle of a project managed with trunk based branching flow. Let's take a look at each step in detail. For instance, we are working with project [https://gitlab.com/Revolgy/branching-playground](https://gitlab.com/Revolgy/branching-playground)

1. Implement change (no matter if it is a feature or fix)
    - If you haven't cloned the repository yet, let's do that: `git clone[git@gitlab.com](mailto:git@gitlab.com):Revolgy/branching-playground.git`
    and then set default upstream to `trunk`: `git branch -u origin/trunk trunk`
    - Now when you have the repository cloned and default upstream is set to trunk, create your branch: `git checkout -b feature/non-prod-env` and implement the change you've planned.
    - After you are happy with the implementation, commit the change with a meaningful comment: `git commit -m "First environment added"`
    - And push it into upstream: `git push origin feature/non-prod-env`
    - In the output of git command you'll get a hyperlink for creating a  merge request:

        ```markdown
        remote:
        remote: To create a merge request for feature/non-prod-env, visit:
        remote:   [https://gitlab.com/Revolgy/branching-playground/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request[source_branch]=feature%2Fnon-prod-env](https://gitlab.com/Revolgy/branching-playground/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=feature%2Fnon-prod-env)
        remote:
        ```

    - When creating merge request please fill in Description thoroughly. Also chose relevant reviewers and option to squash commits when MR is accepted.
    - After merge request is accepted, your change will be in the `trunk` branch
2. The second step in our diagram is initializing a new Release branch. **When a major version of a product is out, it is needed to cut the new Release branch which will track the life of this major version until next Release will come**.
    - Each release should be branched off the current trunk. So first of all make sure that you have checked out the `trunk` branch and it is up to date with the upstream:

        ```markdown
        git checkout trunk
        git pull -r
        ```

    - Now create the new Release branch and push it into upstream:

        ```markdown
        git checkout -b release-1
        git push origin release-1
        ```

    - Also you can tag the very first version of the new release. This will be a repeated action for every new released version (Step 4 in the diagram above).

        ```markdown
        git tag release-1.0
        git push origin release-1.0
        ```

        You can also just push tags instead of specifying `release-1.0`: `git push --tags`

3. The current `release` branch should go along with the `trunk`.  So `trunk` should be periodically merged into the current `release`.
    - Make sure that you've got synced `trunk` branch:

        ```markdown
        git checkout trunk
        git pull -r
        ```

    - Now checkout current `release` branch and merge `trunk` into it.

        ```markdown
        git checkout release-1
        git merge trunk
        ```

4. Cut new Release by tagging relevant commit in the current `release` branch, This step has been done in step 2 while creating the first release. Any other release is no different. Just checkout the branch and tag a commit.
Let's say you want to sync up `trunk` with current `release-1` and create a new release which will be `1.2`

    ```markdown
    git checkout release-1
    git merge trunk
    git tag release-1.2
    git push --tags
    ```

5. The last step in the diagram is backporting a change from the current release to the older one. This option will be used very seldom. For instance, if we fix a critical bug in the current release, but older release which we still support happens to have the same bug.
In such a case, we can not just merge `trunk` into the older `release` branch because it will lead to merging the whole history and our older `release` will become equal to `trunk`. That is not what we want to achieve. So we should use [git-cherry-picking](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) to merge a single commit into an older `release`.
    - Get sha hash of the commit you want to back-port. It can be found in Gitlab of by looking through `git log` output. E.g.:

        ```markdown
        commit 9c8b813348bd34d6b974c929dac338d55344b5a5 (HEAD -> release-2, tag: release-2.1, origin/trunk, origin/HEAD, trunk)
        Author: Anton Vorobiev <anv@revolgy.com>
        Date:   Mon Dec 28 09:48:44 2020 +0100

            Resize staging environment to match production
        ```

        So in this case commit hash we are interested in is `9c8b813348bd34d6b974c929dac338d55344b5a5`

    - Now simply checkout the branch you want to merge the change and invoke the `git cherry-pick` command. Let's say our current release branch is `release-2` and you want to merge the change into `release-1`.

        ```markdown
        git checkout release-1
        git pull -r
        git cherry-pick 9c8b813348bd34d6b974c929dac338d55344b5a5
        git push origin release-1
        ```

        Now after invoking `git log` you will see commit `9c8b813348bd34d6b974c929dac338d55344b5a5` on top of `release-1` branch without any other history from `trunk` or newer release branch.

        New version with that fix can be now released by procedure described in step 4.

## üëÄ Code review
### Goal

Our code review process aims to:

- Improve readability and maintainability,
- Improve robustness and prevent the introduction of defects,
- Leverage the experience of other contributors for each proposed change,
- Follow compliance with standards relative to the project (ie. OWASP, PCI, etc)

therefore nitpicking some irrelevant issues (such as double whitespaces, grammar mistakes, etc) is not the goal. The goal is to educate each other and learn something from the review. Simply said, don't be a dick. üôÇ

**How often to do code review**

Code reviews should be prompt (on the order of hours, not days), therefore a code review should not wait for your response more than a day. The best practice at Revolgy is to reserve an hour of your work-time to do a code review. 

### Reviewee‚Äôs side

#### What to review

All developers should have significant changes reviewed before they are committed to the repository.

#### When to submit for a review

Code reviews should happen after automated checks (tests, style, other CI) have completed successfully, but before the code merges to the repository‚Äôs mainline branch.

#### Preparing code for a review

It‚Äôs better to prepare MRs so we save the reviewer‚Äôs time and motivation. Here are the main things to look for:

- **Scope and size** - Changes should have a **narrow, well-defined, self-contained scope** that they cover exhaustively. For example, a change may implement a new feature or fix a bug. Shorter changes are preferred over longer ones.¬†If a MR makes substantive changes to more than one independent functionality, consider splitting it into multiple separated MRs.
- Provide a helpful **MR description**. Just a few sentences can help with understanding what the code change is about.
- Submit¬†**complete, self-reviewed**¬†(by diff), and¬†**self-tested**¬†MRs. I.e make sure they pass all builds as well as all tests and code quality checks.
- Follow guidelines for the language of the project (such as for [Terraform](https://www.notion.so/Revolgy-Terraform-guidelines-72e07ee7f83b493dbe0e1418ff704eee))
- **Refactoring changes**¬†should not alter behavior. Also¬†behavior-changing changes should avoid refactoring (consider splitting those two into separated MRs).
- Test before submitting the review. Make sure that submitted changes are working as expected.

#### Finding reviewers

Look for at least two reviewers and add the whole team (but at least one) for the MR. The best option is to look for someone who is already familiar with the project (in case you already collaborate on the project with someone).

You need to explicitly add a reviewer to your merge request/commit. 

When you‚Äôre still unsure about the code (or a review from a primary reviewer), you may look for another person to review the MR, who is not being familiar with the project.

For our initial phase of code reviewing, code reviews will be performed only by people working on the project directly (included on statuses, etc.).

### Reviewer‚Äôs side

#### What to check for in code reviews

Assuming the author of the MR paid attention to the **Preparing code for review** chapter and followed it, here‚Äôs a list to which reviewer should pay attention to:

**Purpose**

- **Does this code accomplish the author‚Äôs purpose?** Every change should have a specific reason (new feature, refactor, bugfix, etc). Does the submitted code actually accomplish this purpose?
- **Ask questions.**¬†Functions and classes should exist for a reason. When the reason is not clear to the reviewer, this may be an indication that it should be explained more thoroughly.

**Implementation**

- **How you would have solved the problem?**¬†If it‚Äôs different, why is that? Does your (imaginary) code handle more (edge) cases? Is it shorter/easier/cleaner/faster/safer yet functionally equivalent? Is there some underlying pattern you spotted that isn‚Äôt captured by the current code?
- **Do you see any potential for useful abstractions?**¬†Partially duplicated code often indicates that a more abstract or general piece of functionality can be extracted and then reused in different contexts.
- **Does the change follow standard patterns?**¬†Established codebases often exhibit patterns around naming conventions, program logic decomposition, data type definitions, etc. It is usually desirable that changes are implemented in accordance with existing patterns.
- Check for **new dependencies**. If the MR added a dependency, does it make sense? Is it necesary?

**Legibility and code style**

- **Reading experience.**¬†Did you grasp the concepts in a reasonable amount of time?
- Is the **code consistent with the project in terms of style**, API conventions, etc?

**Maintainability**

- **Does this change break backward compatibility?**
- **Does this code need (integration) tests?**
- **Was the documentation of the added part updated? Is the documentation explanatory?**

**Security**

Verify that API endpoints perform appropriate authorization and authentication consistent with the rest of the codebase. Check for other common weaknesses, e.g., weak configuration, malicious user input, missing log events, etc. When in doubt, refer the CR to an application security expert.

Last but not least, praise concise/readable/efficient/elegant code. üôÇ  Every review request must get a well-written description of why it was or wasn't approved. We do not blame each other, we do not judge each other, we help each other to learn. Everybody does mistakes.

---

TL;DR:

- Every pull request / merge request must be approved at least by 1 other engineer in the repository. Approver and requester cannot be the same person.
- The Pull request cannot be approved by person writing the code.
